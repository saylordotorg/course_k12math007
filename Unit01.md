**Unit 1: The Number System** <span id="1"></span> 
*Imagine that you are shopping. There are signs everywhere for different
sales. You only have a set amount to spend and need to calculate an
estimate for the discount and the tax. This is just one of the many
applications that you will be able complete at the end of Unit 1.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will continue to build on the decimal and fraction
skills you started in previous courses. These rational numbers will be
expanded upon by the addition of positive and negative numbers working
together within the four operations. A focus on the properties will help
you gain an understanding of how the rational numbers work. You will
then extend these skills to applications of percentages, including
discounts, taxes, commissions, and others.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 20 hours and 25
minutes.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 10 hours and 5 minutes  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 10 hours and 20 minutes

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   Solve problems involving integers.  
      
-   Extend the rules of integers to work with other rational numbers,
    such as fractions and decimals.  
      
-   Apply the properties of operations in order to solve problems
    involving all four operations.  
      
-   Write percentages as decimals and fractions.  
      
-   Use percentages to solve real-world problems.

**1.1 Working with Rational Numbers** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Rational numbers are used in everything we do. There are fractions in
cooking and baking, construction, and even using a ruler. Decimals are
also used when measuring items including amounts of money. This section
will build your skills with positive and negative numbers. Then you will
expand these skills to include positive and negative fractions and
positive and negative decimals. Becoming an expert in working with
rational numbers will help you to be more successful in the following
sections and units as the rational numbers are used throughout the
different applications.*

**1.2 Percentages** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Rational numbers have many uses in real-life applications. One of the
most obvious examples would be money and percentages. Throughout the
second half of this unit, you will be looking at how decimals,
fractions, and percentages are related to each other. Then you will use
the different types of numbers to work on examples of these real-life
applications, which include calculating prices after discounts, after
adding a tip or gratuity, or even after you add on the sales tax, just
to name a few examples.*
