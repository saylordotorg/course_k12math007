**Unit 5: Probability and Statistics** <span id="5"></span> 
*Imagine that you would like to open a new business, but you need data
on what the local people would think and whether the business would be
successful. Your work on probability and statistics will help you build
an appropriate sample for surveying and show you how to use your data to
analyze the results and make predictions.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will begin by finding the probability of single
events. This will lead to the probability of compound events. You will
draw inferences based on random sampling, compare multiple samples, and
build representations of events using tables and tree diagrams. From the
models, you will make predictions and calculate the measure of center
and variability.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 11 hours and 30
minutes.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
-   Solve problems involving basic and compound probabilities.  
      
-   Make predictions about an event based on theoretical and
    experimental probabilities.  
      
-   Use data from random samples to make inferences about a
    population.  
      
-   Calculate the measures of center and variability.  
      
-   Create tree diagrams and organized lists to represent sample
    spaces.

**5.1 Probability** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*“There is a 30% chance of rain for Friday.” The chance of something
happening is the probability of an event occurring. Probabilities are
used to help make decisions. A 30% chance of rain is a fairly low
probability of occurring. A 90% chance of rain tells us that it is most
likely going to rain. We may need to cancel plans or at least remember
to bring an umbrella. In this subunit, you will take a look at how to
compute probabilities and how some events can affect the probability of
other events.*

    (Flash)  
                    
     Instructions: In this game, you will answer probability questions
    about the amounts you are able to win. You will place your answer in
    the maroon box at the bottom right. The game will tell you whether
    your answer is correct. If the sound is on when you play the game,
    you will hear a noise for a wrong answer and you will not be given a
    chip. If you are correct, you will be given a chip to drop down the
    plinko board. The hint button places a triangle under each of the
    given values you need to answer the question. This way, you can
    count up the total to get the probability.  
        
     Playing this game should take approximately 15 minutes.

    On this site there are several different interactive spinners. For
    three of the spinners, do the following:

    -   1. Calculate the theoretical probability of the spinner landing
        on red.
    -   2. Complete 20 spins and keep track of the results.
    -   3. Use the results to calculate the experimental probability of
        landing on red.
    -   4. Compare the theoretical to the experimental probability.
    -   5. Make a prediction: If you were to continue spinning the
        spinner 1,000 times, how many times would you expect the spinner
        to land on red?

     Instructions: The probability of landing in the inside shape can be
    calculated by finding the area of the inside shape and the area of
    the outside shape and writing the results as a fraction. This

    therefore change the areas. Follow the directions given in the
    activity. Use the dots below to change the values of the lengths.
    Then, on separate paper, calculate the probability to see if you get
    the same answer as the program. Practice with five different
    lengths.

**5.2 Samples** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Have you ever heard a commercial claim “9 out of 10 dentists recommend
this toothpaste”? The claim that 9 out of 10 dentists like the
toothpaste isn’t very meaningful if 9 of the 10 dentists also work for
that toothpaste company. In that case, the sample that was questioned
does not truly represent the entire population of dentists. In this
subunit, we will take a look at samples and see how a well-chosen sample
can represent the population and help make informed decisions.*

**5.3 Compare Data Sets** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*Oftentimes we look at one set of data in a graph or table. However,
there are times when we might want to compare two different sets of
data. Maybe Mr. Smith’s math class is in a competition with Ms.
Sanchez’s class. Both classes have a set of data that will need to be
compared to see who wins the competition. This subunit looks at
different ways of comparing multiple sets of data. It starts by looking
at different types of graphs and measures of center and variability.
Then it continues on to discuss multiple sets of data.*

     Instructions: There is a detailed list of the steps that need to be
    taken to get the MAD at the bottom of the worksheet. Follow them to
    calculate the MAD. Then use the option to show the steps in \#1 to
    check your work.

     Instructions: Read the lesson on creating a box-and-whisker plot
    until you reach the videos from Khan Academy. While reading, take
    note of what the following terms mean and where they appear in a
    box-and-whisker plot: median, upper quartile, and lower quartile.

     Instructions: Start by reading the example of using data from the
    Iditarod in Alaska. Continue reading until you reach the videos.
    Take note of the following while reading.

    -   1. How is the stem different than a leaf?
    -   2. How can I write a three-digit number as a stem and leaf?
    -   3. What does the key for a stem and leaf plot look like?
    -   4. How can I get the mean, median, and mode from the stem and
        leaf plot?

    Next, watch the video from Khan Academy in order to see a stem and
    leaf plot made and why it is important. Finally, using the
    information in the reading and the video, answer the questions in
    the “Time to Practice” section.  
        
     Completing these activities should take approximately 1 hour.
