**Unit 2: Ratio and Proportional Reasoning** <span id="2"></span> 
*Imagine you are building a new tree house. The blueprint has the
design, but on a much smaller scale. You will be able to use
proportional reasoning to help solve problems like this one and change
the small design to life-size dimensions.*  
    
 *In this unit, proportional reasoning is the focus. You will begin by
taking a look at ratios and rates and how they help us to build
proportions. You will analyze proportional relationships including scale
drawing and similar figures. Once you have built the foundational
skills, you will model life situations using proportions and graphs.
This will help you build a definition of slope and begin to distinguish
proportional relationships from other relationships. *

**2.1 Ratios and Rates** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*We make comparisons every day. You might hear someone mention the
number of boys to girls, apples to oranges, or even missed basketball
shots to total shots taken. Sometimes we make more complex comparisons
with two different units like miles per hour or pages per minute. Theses
comparisons are ratios and rates and will be the focus of the first
section of Unit 2.*

**2.2 Proportions** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*When two ratios or rates are equal to each other we have a proportion.
Proportions become very useful when trying to make predictions or
conversions. You might be designing a model for a new product or a
blueprint for the next building in the city. Both of these require
creating a smaller image of a real-life product. Then a proportion can
be used to make conversions from the models to the real-life object.*

    Polygons”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/K12MATH007-Scale-Factor-of-Similar-Polygons.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read through the “Guidance” and “Guided Practice”
    sections to see how ratios and proportions can be used with
    geometric shapes. As you are reading, take note of how the angles in
    the similar figures are related and how the sides of similar figures
    are related. Finally, solve practice problems 1 - 4 only at the
    bottom of the page.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.
