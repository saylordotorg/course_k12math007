**Unit 4: Geometry** <span id="4"></span> 
*Imagine you work for a packaging company. You need to design a brand
new package for a new product, but it has to meet certain requirements
regarding how much space it takes up and how much materials it takes to
make it. This is one of the many applications you will be able to solve
at the end of this unit in geometry.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will start your study by working with shapes, the
angles that form them, their perimeters, and their areas. The
two-dimensional shapes will help you build and describe pieces of
three-dimensional prisms and pyramids. Finally, you will take all these
skills to solve real-world problems involving surface area and volume.*

**4.1 Angles** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*Angles are part of the building blocks for polygons and polyhedrons.
They are important in constructing buildings and houses to ensure that
walls, floors, and ceilings will not break. In addition, angles are used
in art, architecture, and design to create visually pleasing designs. In
this subunit, you will learn more about angles and angle relationships.*

**4.4 Three-Dimensional Shapes** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*The two-dimensional shapes that we have studied so far can be joined
together to form three-dimensional shapes. We live in a
three-dimensional world, so the three-dimensional shapes used have many
real-life applications. Now we have the boxes, cans, globes, and even
wedges of cheese shapes forming. To further study three-dimensional
shapes, we discuss covering the shapes through surface area and filling
the shapes through volume.*
