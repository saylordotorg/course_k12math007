Numbers are everywhere. When we are shopping we are faced with decimals.
In our cooking, we work with fractions. When it comes to the stock
market, we can see positives and negatives. In this course, we will we
focus on these rational numbers and understanding the operations when
working with them. This course includes five units with rational numbers
used throughout. In Unit 1, we will build on our skills with integers,
decimals, and fractions, with a focus on the properties that are at the
heart of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. These skills
are used to help build an understanding of proportional relationships
through ratios, rates, and scale drawings, and similar figures in Unit
2. Variables will join the rational numbers in Unit 3 so that real-life
mathematical problems can be expressed and solved. Mathematical
reasoning will continue to grow in this unit as simple equations and
inequalities are used to model different real-life scenarios.
Two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes will be used to solve
problems involving surface area and volume in Unit 4. Rational numbers
will work in conjunction with formulas as we continue to model real-life
problems with mathematics. Finally, in Unit 5, rational numbers will be
used to analyze populations and make predictions. This course extends
many of the units from grade 6 and builds further mathematical reasoning
to prepare you for the content of the grade 8 math course.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Apply and extend understandings of operations with rational numbers.
-   Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world
    problems.
-   Generate equivalent expressions using mathematical properties.
-   Solve real-life problems using numerical and algebraic expressions
    and equations.
-   Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe
    relationships between them.
-   Solve real-life problems involving angle measures, area, surface
    area, and volume.
-   Use random sampling to drawn inferences about populations.
-   Draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.
-   Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate
    probability models.

### Course Information

**Welcome to Math 7.** Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer: **Deborah Grawn  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): This site has extra
    videos and practice on topics that are not listed within the course.
    If you are struggling with a topic, it would be a good idea to
    review some of the supplemental material on this site.
-   [Illustrative
    Mathematics](http://www.illustrativemathematics.org/): This site has
    tasks (concepts modeled mostly with real-world word problems) on
    several concepts that apply to seventh-grade math. Be sure to choose
    the K-8 Standards section and then continue to the seventh-grade
    area. These are very rigorous activities followed by detailed
    descriptions of multiple solutions.
-   [CK-12](http://www.ck12.org/student/): This site has explanations on
    several math topics listed within the course. If you are struggling
    with a topic, this site will allow you to search for more
    assistance.
-   [orgLib:](http://orglib.com/home.aspx) This is another free site
    with plenty of assessment questions and answers to keep you
    practicing. Plus, the site is organized by standards to help make it
    easy to find which areas you need to practice.

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
These assigned materials include readings, videos, exercises, tasks,
assessments, and a final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the other assignments listed in the above paragraph.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **77 **hours and 25 minutes****. Each unit includes a
“time advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend
on each subunit. It may be useful to take a look at these time
advisories and determine how much time you have over the next few weeks
to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For example, Unit
1 should take approximately 20 hours, with the first assignment listed
as taking approximately 40 minutes. Perhaps you can sit down with your
calendar and decide to complete one or two assignments in a day.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions: **It would be helpful to have a notebook or binder
for all the materials you will complete in this course. As you read or
watch videos and PowerPoint presentations, take careful notes on a
separate sheet of paper. Mark down any important equations, formulas,
and definitions that stand out to you. It will be useful to use all of
this work as a review prior to completing the final exam.  
    
 While you are working through the course, focus on understanding what
you are doing. The early material creates the tools that you will use in
later sections, so make sure you do not skip over it. Solutions are
included in most exercises to check your work and to be utilized as a
learning tool. When you answer incorrectly or are having trouble with a
problem, you can use the provided solutions to work backward to
understand the process. When you are struggling with a topic even after
exploring all the given resources, searching the Internet for additional
assistance or visiting some of the sites listed above for supplemental
explanations or practice would be very useful. Some other useful
Internet sites are [Quizlet](http://www.quizlet.com/), which is a study
site that houses several of the topics within this course and can be
used as a study tool; [Purplemath](http://www.purplemath.com/), which
has explanations and step-by-step guidance and
examples; [Brightstorm](http://www.brightstorm.com/math), has videos to
view for concepts as well as practice problems; and [Math
Help](http://www.mathhelp.com/), which is a site with videos on topics
covered in this course, along with practice worksheets and solutions.
