**Unit 3: Expressions and Equations** <span id="3"></span> 
*Imagine you are keeping track of the growth of bacteria in a science
lab. You would like to make predictions based on the patterns you are
starting to see, but extending a table of values would take way too
long. One of the many goals of this unit will be to represent this
real-life data as an equation and then solve it.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will develop your algebraic skills by writing and
simplifying expressions using variables, numbers, and symbols. You will
extend these skills to equations with multiple steps, including
combining like terms and using the distributive property. Finally, you
will take all of these skills and use them to help represent and solve
real-life problems using equations and inequalities.*

**3.2 Simplifying Expressions** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*As we begin to model different real-life situations using mathematical
expressions, we will need to show the expressions using multiple
representations. Oftentimes a different, but equivalent, representation
of a mathematical expression will help shed light on different features
of the expression. For example, we might use the expression 20x + 36 to
represent the area of a rectangle. However, if we had written it as
4(5x + 9), we could then see two possible factors that could represent
the length (4) and width (5x + 9) of the rectangles. Both expressions
are equal to each other, but the second expression gives us a little
more information.*

**3.3 Evaluating Expressions** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*To better understand how and what an algebraic expression represents,
it is helpful to look at the value of the expression depending on the
value of the variable. For example, we are given the expression 3x + 5
to represent the total cost of visiting a fair, where the variable x
represents the number of rides or activities. If we know someone took
part in 11 rides or activities, we can now calculate the total cost.*  
    
 *3x + 5*  
 *3(11) + 5*  
 *33 + 5*  
 *38*  
    
 *This expression is equal to 38 when x = 11. That means that this
person spent $38 to go to the fair and participate in 11 rides or
activities. The value of the expression will change as the value of x
changes.*  
    
 *In this subunit, you will practice evaluating different expressions
and formulas and seeing how the value changes as the variables change.*

**3.4 Solving Equations** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*In this subunit, we will grow from expressions to equations. Instead of
being able to plug in multiple values for the variable in expressions,
we will now be able to solve for a certain solution in an equation. This
subunit starts with solving two-step equations and then builds to
equations with multiple steps, including steps that involve combining
like terms and the distributive property.*

    (HTML) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: While watching the video, copy the equations,
    practice showing the steps, and then check algebraically. For
    example, if you were solving the equation 3x – 5 = 25, you need to
    show the algebraic steps to prove that when x = 10, the equation
    will be true. Then, when you check your work, you will replace the x
    with the answer and evaluate to ensure that it is correct. Here is
    an example of checking algebraically.  
        
     3x – 5 = 25  
     3(10) – 5 = 25  
     30 – 5 = 25  
     25 = 25

     Instructions: Skip the “Unit Conversion” section at the beginning
    of this webpage. Begin reading when you see the title “Using
    Algebraic Models.” While reading the remainder of the text, take
    note of key vocabulary terms that help convert words into equations.
    Then, create equations and solve the 10 problems under “Problem
    Set.”  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour.

**3.6 Inequalities** <span id="3.6"></span> 
*Imagine that you have $300 to go shopping for school clothes. The total
of all the items you want to purchase must be less than or equal to
$300. It would be OK to get to the register and have a total of $238 or
$287 or even $199. As long as the total is not more than $300, you have
enough money to cover the costs. This is an example of an inequality.
This subunit will use your equation-solving skills to now solve
inequalities and graph the solutions.*

     Instructions: As the game begins, you will be given an inequality.
    Your job is to hit asteroids with numbers that would be a solution
    to the inequality. To play this game, you will use the arrow keys
    and the space bar. You will use the space bar to hit the target.  
        
     Playing this game should take approximately 15 minutes.
